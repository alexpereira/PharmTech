# PharmTech 1.0

Studying using methods involving memorization is already hard enough, so we are creating PharmTech to facilitate the process.

PharmTech is a study guide app for BHCC PharmTech Students learning the 200 most commonly prescribed drugs. Alongside generic names, the app will feature information such as Brand name, Purpose, DEA Schedule, Special Concerns, Drug Category, and Study Topic so that you can an easily access all the information you need. Most notably, the app will feature playback audio for each generic and brand drug name to help you retain what you study.

The app will also features a quizzing tool. You can quiz yourself and keep track of your learning progress. You can choose from a variety of quizzing methods such as Flashcard mode, in which your phone acts as a flashcard in order to test your knowledge.
